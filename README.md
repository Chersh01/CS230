**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client wants a web based game that can be played on multiple platforms. The game is based on a current game Draw it or Lose it and is only available on the android devices. Some requirements: 1. Multiple devices 2. The ability to have more than one team. 3. Unique team names so there are no duplicates 4. Unique names 5. One instance should exists at the same time.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think overall I did everything faily well on the document. I think that I put together the UML diagram pretty well. I enjoy making diagrams so this came pretty easy to me.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The document gives a lot of information, and a great resource to refer to while creating the code. Working through and making the document gave me a great understanding of what the client wanted.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that I put everything together pretty good, but I guess if I had to revise anything it would be the evaluation. I would add to the development tools and maybe write less for the server side

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

It was not too challenging to interpret the users needs. But I was able to do research on their requirements and determine what needed to be included. The users needs should always be considered. The user's are the ones who are going to make the game a success so it needs to be geared towards them.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
